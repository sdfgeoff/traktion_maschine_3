This is a cute little RC tracked vehicle inspired by the "Tiny Trak" craze. It's a little bigger than most but has articulated suspension!

Nearly all the parts are 3D printed, with the only non-printed parts being the motors+electronics and some M3x10 bolts/nuts. 
A future version will probably use bearings for the boogies because this one has a bit much slop and when the tracks are under tension, they can jam. 

For electronics I used two 18650 cells for power (mounted in the tray/ute part), and continous rotation servos. I've also uploaded parts for an N20 gear motor build, but I haven't tested it.

Tracks can be made via silicone molding (molds included) or printed from TPU.


Model/CAD is done in Blender 2.8
